                <h2>Policies Of The Institution And Your Academics</h2>
                <p>Delta State University, Abraka is an excellent centre of learning with clearly defined policies and rules of engagements that her students are provided with in numerous formats and occassions. This she does through Orientation services during matriculations and other occassions. In 
                    the most recent times, at first contact all students are provided with a students' guide,<em>' DELSU SURVIVAL GUIDE FOR STUDENTS '</em>, a book that explicitly spells out what and what not the university deems acceptable. Furthermore, The Delsu Counselling Center provides 
                    a <a href="publication.html" title="Read about the book"> hand book</a> to students and staff of the university to enrich their experiences here in the Delsu community. In the same vein, all departments in an attempt to familiarize her students with the university's academic environment entrenches the university policies through their handbooks.</p>
                <p>All of the above exercises are not mere forms of redundancy but to stress the importance, how much the institution upholds her policies and the length she goes to implementing them. Having said all of these, it becomes expedient to highlight some of them and how your compliance will 
                    ultimately affect your academic performance.</p>

                <div class="h2"><h2 id="fee"># School Fees</h2></div>
                <hr><hr>
                <p>Like many higher institutions, Delta State University  has stringent policies regarding payment of fees. Non-compliance to payment of school fees amounts to losing your stake as a student and when this happens, the entire academic prospect is gone. At this stage, we are no longer 
                   talking about performing high or low, what we are saying is, your studentship is cut short because you will not be allowed to sit for examination or probably lose the whole session if you differ your studies on the account of lack of finance and you would not want such to happen 
                   in the first place. Usually, at the beginning of each session, students are expected to pay their fees and every other necessary due within a stipulated time frame. Nevertheless, there are several occasions where students can be allowed an extra time before they pay up but that 
                   is no excuse for not complying in time if you have yours ready. The best advice on this issue is, on no condition should you divert or spend your school fees if it has have been provided for because late payment usually attracts fine.</p>
                <p>Timely payment of school fees comes with a lot of benefits that are positive to your academic journey just as late payment and noncompliance comes with its told consequences. Some of these include:</p>
                
                <hr>
                    <h4><em>Emotional stability and better concentration</em></h4>
                <hr>
                     Academics require best level of emotional stability and concentration without which, little to nothing can be achieved. The thought of not having paid your fees can put you in crisis especially when you realize 
                    time is fast closing in or on the worst case scenario, when the chances of paying is near impossible. When this happens, your attention will be divided and the struggle to keep yourself together during lectures can be very terrible. A good number of talented students have lost 
                    grip of sound academic grades because of this. Hence, we recommend you take full advantage of this piece of information at your disposal.
                <hr>
                    <h4><em>Positive self-image</em></h4>
                <hr>
                    Self-image refers to an individual's perception of himself. Self-image becomes important at this point because it influences the direction and intensity of learning. Students with positive self-image tend to learn better because they 
                        engage learning more actively than their counterparts when they chose to. On the other hand, the thoughts of not having paid can be very demoralizing and this can extend to making you develop a negative self-image that will not only affect your learning but your mental health 
                        and this is no good for your academics. 
                       
                <hr>
                <h4><em>Planning</em></h4>
                <hr>
                    For any student to succeed, there must be adequate planning. Planning refers to formulation of course of action with regard to finances and other resources. Having your fees paid in time will enable you to know what you are left with and how to put 
                    it to good use. Usually, some students resume new academic sessions with a lump sum of all the money they may be needing throughout the entire period and often than not, there has been several cases where students have spent into what was meant to be their school fees simply 
                    because they kept all the money with themselves. To avoid this, it is in your best interest you pay your fees in time at the appropriate designated places and units. More so, payment of fees is one major criteria to enable registration of courses and timely payment will give you 
                    room to consult with your course adviser on what courses you will be taking for that session. This alone will go a long way to familiarizing you with the appropriate courses to be taken as well knowing how to go about developing a functional personal time table to guide your 
                    studies through the session.

                <hr><hr>
                <p>One other information that you must have as a student here in Delsu to enable you succeed is that, you must know that it is mandatory for all students to register for courses at the beginning of every session. Course registration here in delsu and many other institutions is in two 
                orders. The online and manual course registration. The course form should be duly completed and signed by relevant and authorized persons. Failure to heed and comply would mean forfeiting to sit for examination in whatever courses not registered or not having it recorded if eventually you 
                sat for it.</p>
                <p>In Delsu, there is minimum and maximum number of units of courses to be registered for, for each session. The minimum number is 30 units, while 48 units stand as the maximum. Usually, a course is 2, 3 or 4 units; this is usually determined by a number of factors like significance.
                    The best directive for registration for courses is domicile with your course adviser. Please refer to your department for richer information or contact your course adviser for best details. You can as well click <a href="login.html">here</a>
                    or click on the live session on the top menu of this page to talk with a nearby counselor via direct communication channel. <a href="#top">Go to menu</a></p>
                <p>Having highlighted how to go about course registration, it becomes necessary at this stage to pin point how the exercise can affect your academic pursuit.</p>
                
                <hr><h4><em> At the instance of not registering;</em></h4><hr>
                    The essence of coming to the university is to acquire education and be awarded a degree at the end of the program. As earlier said, failure to register for courses as at when due will disqualify you from being examined in 
                    in those courses or having your performance and scores recorded if eventually you sat for the examination and this is tantamount having a failed dream because the university will not award you its degree when it never examined your achievement and mastery of the course content. When 
                    this is the case, you are advised to write to write through the appropriate channels to the Deputy Vice Chancellor Academics, applying for re-opening of your portal to allow you register your courses. For further enquiry and guidance, please come to the Delta State University Counseling
                    Center or click <a href="login.html">here</a> to talk with a nearby counselor.</li> 
                <hr><h4><em> At the instance of registering for wrong courses;</em></h4><hr>
                    Registering for wrong courses can pose a very ugly situation for any student. The best analogy for kind of situation is that of a traveler who boarded a flight or vehicle going to another destination different from 
                    his. In the case of the traveler, he usually ends up spending his time and money in a futile journey or quickly exits the vehicle if it were possible. The same is the case of a student who registered for wrong courses because he/she ends up investing time and effort to sit for courses 
                    that are not relevant to his field of study. In some situations, students who are victims of this terrible blunder out of negligence may not be aware of what they have done but sooner than later do they realize they are having standing courses to sit for because the wrong courses 
                    registered for have been inputted on them. Correcting this ugly situation can be very costly so we advise you endeavour to have your course registration done by you and consult with your course adviser before doing so. Early registration can also be of great advantage because you will 
                    have enough time to make modifications if need be.
                <hr><h4><em>At the instance of exhausting the maximum units allowed per session;</em></h4><hr>
                    The maximum unit allowed per session is 48 units and that is it. At the instance of exhausting the allowed number of units in a session, you may have a number of issues to face and this not healthy
                    for your academics. Going about how to remedy the situation can make you lose concentration and become demoralized. This can usually be as a result having too many standing courses from previous sessions or registering for wrong courses which we talked about in a previous section in 
                    this page. When this is the case, you will automatically go on a spill over or extension to be able to graduate because the university will not grant you a degree if you do not clear all standing courses which are mostly core to your discipline. Please refer to your course adviser on 
                    or come to the Counseling Center for help on this matter.
                <hr><h4><em>At the instance of not reaching the minimum expected units per session;</em></h4><hr>
                    While the maximum is placed at 48 units, the minimum is stationed at 30 units but just as exhausting the allowed number of units per session can create problems, not reaching the bench mark is no 
                    good too. Before you are awarded the University's degree in any discipline, it is expected you receive training in different target areas or courses designed by curriculum experts to create a complimentary effect that will play out in you becoming a finished product. Not attaining the 
                    base line of 30 units per session simply indicates you did not receive appropriate training in requisite theoretical and empirical tract of the degree in view. Usually, in an attempt to boycott academic work, students are tempted to and intentionally ignore or refuse to register for 
                    some courses thinking there will no adverse effect little did they know they are far from the truth, they will not be found wanting. On no condition should you fall victim because the consequence of course is, Delsu will not award you her degree because you will not be able to fit in and 
                    match up the challenges you are supposed to globally.

                <hr><hr>
                <p>To dress is simply to clothe oneself in a befitting way. Clothes on their own are apparels worn over the body to cover oneself but with fashion and its constant evolution, materials, patterns, colours, and styles used on clothes have so modified that the very nature and essence of clothing which is 
                to cover the body is almost close to being defeated. Delta State University is an institution of illustrious standing and has remained an organ for transmitting the norms, values, and cultural heritage of the African society and for this reason is tenacious to moral and ethical fashion. We are not 
                saying the university is archaic and old fashioned in any sense, in reality the university promotes fashion and many other forms of art but that is not enough excuse for students to debase themselves in the name of fashion. As it were, institutions of learning are not only meant to train learners 
                in knowledge but also in character as part of its curriculum. Delsu  has a strict policy on dressing that student and staff must comply with. Apart from diverse dress codes that are upheld by various departments and faculties, the institution's policy on dressing is such a simple one as, dress decently.
                Dress appropriately for the purpose learning. Some notable dressing deemed indecent by the university includes:</p>
            
                <li> Wearing transparent clothes</li>
                <li> Wearing tattered and ripped jeans</li>
                <li> Mini-Skirts</li>
                <li> Bumper Shorts</li>
                <li> Sagging trousers</li>
                <li> Non-natural coloured hair/unusual make-up.</li>
            
                <p>Not adhering to the university's directive on dressing can be of adverse effect to your succeeding as a student here in Delsu because you will not be allowed to enter the vicinity of the university let alone attending lectures or sitting for examinations.</p>
                <p> Categorically speaking, the mission statement of Delsu is, "promotion of quality education, character and meeting the challenges of our time through exemplary scholarship and professionalism". In Delta State University therefore, great effort is made to implementing its policies on dressing for many 
                reasons some of which are outlined below as part of effort to fully actualize its mission.</p>
            
                <hr><h4><em>To protect students from harsh atmospheric and weather conditions as they learn;</em></h4><hr>
                    Delsu is located within the core tropics of the globe. Here the Sun barely goes down and continues to beam ultraviolet and other powerful radiations capable of causing health conditions ranging from 
                    ordinary skin burns to skin cancer. Fashion is good; looking beautiful is not a taboo but when it is to endanger you, what is point? The institution, bearing in mind and for love for her students makes no compromise at allowing students expose themselves on the absolute level in the name of fashion. 
                    Every student irrespective of socio-economic, cultural and religious background are to be properly covered and protected from prevalent climatic conditions.</li>
                <hr><h4><em>To abhor and protect students from sexual harassment and abuse;</em></h4><hr>
                    In comparing Delsu with other universities of equal rank, it is an epitome of an ideal university with zero cases of sexual violence within its four walls. It is no magic that the university has kept this record,
                    thanks to its policies on dressing. It is true that sexual violence has a complex root in so many factors but investigations have shown that female precipitation and male sexuality are very prominent. Female precipitation is usually the excuse that male perpetuators come up with, while female perpetuators 
                    on the other hand are quick to push the blame on male sexuality. This back and forth tossing of blames usually creates a situation when seeking justice for victims that is why prevention strategies have remained the best way out of sexual violence especially on campuses. One of such prevention strategies
                    is caution in dressing within male and female students. For the sake of protecting students' dignity, they are admonished to dress modestly.</li>
                <hr><h4><em>To incorporate in students expected behaviours in the corporate world of work;</em></h4><hr>
                    The ultimate goal of education and training received by students is  for the students to contribute to economic life and extend knowledge in different fields of human endeavour which together makes up 
                    the corporate world of work. In the world of work where careers and occupations are catigorized by professionalism, there are expected professional conducts which every member of a given profession must live by. These expected behaviours go beyond ability to discharge one's duties to even mode of 
                    dressing. For this reason, you are able to distinguish between a medical doctor and an engineer at a glance and consequently know whom to run to depending on what emergency you have. While a sales representative may be dressed on suits and appear smart, an engineer and other technicians preferably go 
                    by their typical jean trousers and polo shirts. This is not a thing of religion per say, rather, the casual jean trousers and polo shirts allow them to easily manipulate machines and physical objects to which they are trained for. For this reason, as a way of preparing its products for the world of work, 
                    Delsu tries to incorporate professional attributes in her students not just in knowledge but also in mode of dressing. A paramedical student therefore who opted for paramedical studies, should endeavour to dress like those in the real world of work who are assumed as his/her role models.</li>
                <hr><h4><em>To help students improve their personal appearance;</em></h4><hr>
                    Personal appearance is a very important aspect of us as people. The very human nature is such that we presume about alot things by their mere appearance. This session is not attempting to find justification as as to why this 
                    phenomenon is part of the society we live in but to give you the rationale behind the university's stance on students' attitude to fashion. Many young and promising individuals have lost opportunities and fringe benefits all because of their personal appearance. Personal appearance here is a totality 
                    of how you look before others. It includes your carriage and dressing too. Generally speaking, people's dressing to a great deal determine how they are addressed. It is for this reason among other things mentioned that the university is very much interested in your grooming.</li>

                <div class="h2"><h2 id="att"># Attendance</h2></div>
                <hr><hr>
                <p>Attendance is a state of being present. In academics, it has a paramount position because learning can only be possible when there is a form of activity and interaction between a learner and the learning material. Because of the indispensable role it plays in the learning process, it is has become a basic 
                ingredient for high performance in academic venture. By attendance, we are talking about being present in lectures, practicals, and seminars. No doubt, a great deal of learning takes place while in solitude with recorded tapes, notes, texts, and other forms of learning materials but integrated classroom
                learning and other forms of interaction with a facilitator or tutor will always have its place whether the interaction is direct-real communication or virtual-online communication like the Delsu Learning Management System (DLMS), and Open Distance Learning (ODL).</p>
                <p>Attendance to lectures among other things enhances scholastic ability through active particpation, exchange of views, and healthy relationship between students themselves and between students and lecturers. The expected behaviour patterns of students during lecture time include:</p>
                
                <li> Note making</li>
                <li> Concentration</li>
                <li> Questioning</li>
            
                <p>To make the most out of lecture time, you are to engage in any of these one at a time. You should avoid the idea of engaging in all simultaneously. If you are making notes, you should not be asking questions at thesame time.</p>
                <p>Here in Delsu, attendance is mandatory. The university recommends 70% attendance before a student can be allowed to write examinations. To be put in perspective, a student is expected to be present in 7 out 10 classes as the 
                case may be before he can sit for examinations. We therefore advice students to endeavour to be conversant with lecture schedules so as not to miss out in classes and also avoid to form the habbit covering up for colleagues 
                or having friends cover up for them because even when they succeed to bypass and meet the bench mark of 70% attendance, the invaluable foredeal of being present in lectures, seminars, and practicals can not be substituted. </p>     
                <p>Some specific benefits of attendance to your academic pursuit includes the following.</p>    
                <hr><h4><em> Attendance provides opportunity for interactive learning;</em></h4><hr>
                Solitude learning is good and can be very effective in many situations but an interactive learning where you have a facilitator is highly 
                recmendable in academics because it provides the opportunity for exchange of views about a particular subject. This exchange of views can be between students themselves or between them and their lecturers. When views are 
                exchanged, knowledge is enriched. It also provide you the opportunity to ask questions about the same subjects. This will help provide you with a clearer view on the subject peradventure you are having a misconception of ideas. Except 
                you are superhuman, you will always have need of a facilitator in the place of learning because even the most talented learners can misconceive ideas. Misconception of ideas brings falsehood in learning and consequent failure in academics
                so we endulge you to form the habbit of being present in every learning situation that will ever arise while you are here in Delsu.
                <hr><h4><em> Attendance increases your scholastic aptitude;</em></h4><hr>
                Many a students have not had a success story in academics because of low scholastic aptitude. Scholastic aptitude in this context is simply the natural ability to learn
                in the school setting. Not everyone can learn optimally in the school setting. This does not imply they are daft or have zero intelligence because people in this category that were privileged to recieve appropriate counsel have benefited 
                from informal learning. Formal learning as in the case of school setting require a different skill set and abilities which can only be acquired when a learner is willing and shows interest to participate in classroom learning. Being present 
                in classroom situation boosts scholastic aptitude because as a learner observes the lecturer go about his business, he/she becomes motivated to learn and engages his/her mind in the process especially if the lecturer has the content to give.
                Without this scholastic aptitude, academics can be very frustrating and performance will remain poor.
                <hr><h4><em> Attendance avails you the opportunity of partaking in impromtu tests;</em></h4><hr>Another salient reason why we enjoin you to form the habit of attending lectures regularly is that of the opportunity it avails you to partake in 
                impromptu tests. There have been so many cases where students miss out in tests and lose potential marks which could have contributed to their overall grading on the account of their being absenteeism. As a way of assessing students’ commitment 
                to learning, lecturers usually give unannounced tests and such situations do not permit students who are not steadfast in studies to perform optimally, let alone, those who are absent altogether. We advise you familiarized yourself with your 
                lectures schedules and follow accordingly so as not to miss out in these kinds of tests. If you must absent from classes, make sure you seek permission from the appropriate channels so as not to be so unfortunate.     
                <hr><h4><em> Attendance contributes to your overall grading;</em></h4><hr>Although, this is not static but here in Delsu, being regular in classes constitutes over twenty percent of your continuous assessment and amounts to about five percent 
                of the entire grade in every of the courses you registered for. On the average, there are about twelve study weeks in a semester within each students receive lectures and regular attendance accrues a student about 5 marks out of a total of 
                attainable 100 marks depending on the nature of the course, the lecturer, the department, or faculty. 
                <hr><h4><em> Attendance Prepares you for examination;</em></h4><hr>Furthermore, attendance to lectures prepares you for examination as much as it is a criterion for eligibility. During lectures, the interaction between course lecturers and 
                students helps the student master the course content and therefore prepares them for examination. Aside from this interaction, as a rule, every student is expected to be present in at least 70% of scheduled lectures before they are eligible 
                for examination. To be put in perspective, you must attend seven out of ten lectures or more before you are allowed to sit for examination in any particular course that you registered for.

                <hr><hr>Examination malpractice is any and every form of behavior that is unethical and brings about falsehood in the supposed outcomes of examinations. It is simply any act that falls short of 
                accepted behaviors, before, during, and after the course of examination with the intent of enhancing performance during or influencing results after. Here in Delsu, examination malpractice is a grave offence and highly punishable. It ranges from 
                copying to gross misconduct with each having an approved general guideline form senate for students’ disciplinary committees.

            <h2>Delsu Learning Settings And Your Academics</h2>
            <p>Delta State University learning settings takes four versions. The nature of the learning setting depends on the disclipline area and kind of program. Though lectures and seminars occupy a central role in the delivery of knowledge programs. Other teaching methods and technologies are gradually being integrated onto the system.
                Work placements, field trips, laboratory or studio work, teaching practice, practicum, industrial training, group presentation amongs others are being introduced into programs to enhance experiencial learning which gives students valuable vocational experience.
                </p>
                <p>In whichever way learning is presented, we advice you to participate actively and make concerted effort to make inputs when opportunities are given as it is the only way to maximize university education.</p>

                <div class="h2"><h2 id="lec">Lectures</h2></div>

                <hr><hr>
                <p>Lectures are educational talks to an audience particulary in a unioversity setting. The lecturer introduces the topic, and highlights sailient points of interest. In the course of delivering the lecture, the lecturer uses subject specific language and technical terms. In this kind of teaching, the lecturers serves as springboards
                for further indepedent study. Interaction during lecture time depends on the lecturers' style; while some talk at great lenght uninterrupted, others ask questions, encourage discussion and students opportunity to air their opinions. Whatever method is adopted by the lecturer, the students are expected to listen, make notes on key points,
                and prepare for examinations based on learnt concepts and course outline. Here in Delsu, typical lecture duration is 120 minutes within which full attention and participation is required from the students</p>

                <hr><hr>
                <div class="h2"><h2 id="pra">Practicals</h2></div>

                <hr><hr>
                <p>Practical is an act of putting into practice the theoretical aspect of topics taught by the lecturer. Here, students are go into the laboratory to perform experiments for the sciences and medical sciences, while those in education do micro-teaching or micro practicing in designated locations. The essence of this is to develop relevant 
                skills, build competence, and provide professional experience. Duration of practicals vary widely depending on a variety of factors. In the course of practicals, students are provided with the opportunity and guided on how to work with various tools, gadgets, equipments, facilities, and specimen under controled conditions so as gain practical 
                knowledge to build upon whatever knowledge that has been delivered to them through other means.</p>

                <hr><hr>
                <p>The settings of seminars differs, depending on the discipline and kind of program. The meeting usually consits of a leader and a group of students between 3-30. The aim is to examine and extend knowledge of the topics already covered during lectures. Most times, in-depth discussion on key issues; related texts, articles, and theories 
                is done. The leader thereafter instructs each group member to research and present to other members of the group at a later date. It provides opportunity for students to practice essential academic and professional skills such as discussing thier subject with clarity, arguing logically and tactfully, listening to different points of view, 
                making considered criticisms, comments, expressing their opinions and identifying the evidence upon which they. Seminar duration in Delsu differ across disciplines and programs due to a number of factors.</p>

                <div class="h2"><h2 id="exp">Experiential Learning</h2></div>

                <hr><hr>
                <p>This is a work based leaning situation where students are given the opportunity to access, Utilize, and build on their knowledge from practical encounters with the subject being studied. The purpose is to widen their horizon, garther practical information and develop favourable attitude toward specific work demands and experimental know-how
                of occupation. During this period, students have the opportunity to interact with people on the job, engage in the job, and ask relevant questions relating to job security, hazards, and financial benefits. Here in, students get the look and feel of the work place in the natural setting and by so doing get a more comprehensive picture of their 
                careers and occupations with its tension, stresses as well as responsibilities and personality trait requirements. The essence is to further strenghten, establish and deepen understanding of their subject and prepare the individual for employment in the said profession. The duration of work-based Learning varies with courses of study but generally 
                fall between 6 weeks to 24 weeks. At the end of the work-based learning, students are expected to write a report on personal observations during its entire course.</p>

            <h2>Delsu Assessment, Evaluation, And Placement</h2>
            
            <p>Assessment is simply the systematic collection, review, analysis, and use of data about educational programs undertaken for the purpose of improving student learning and development while evaluation gives the value judgement. Typically, they go together 
                and are core aspects of every education and training program. Without assessing a student, no value judgement can made as to whether thesame have been able to acquire successfully or the extent of mastery of the intended learning outcome. For every 
                such program as university education, there are always preset objectives which constitute the intended learning outcome in line with a defined curriculum which in itself is determined by so many factors including government policies on education. The students being the recipient may also have his set 
                goals for coming to our esteemed institution in the first place but when these goals are at variance with curricular objectives at extreem levels, creating a balance can be very difficult. We therefore, advice all our dear incubent and prospective students 
                to tailor their academic goals in line with the said curricular objectives because the later remains the standard against which their performance is weighed and judgement made.</p>
            
                <p>For every degree in view, there are several courses which a student must be learned and assessed before award. Assessing our students takes the form of continuous assessment and examination through which grades are assigned depending on the level of mastery 
                which a student demonstrates. Mastery here, could be excellent, very good, average, minimal, or poor with each represented on a norminal scale as 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', and 'F' respectively. To do this, students are;</p>
                <p>&bullet; Assessed through continuous assessment(CA) and examination and performance weighed against preset objectives,</p> 
                <p>&bullet; Scores are assigned to students’ performance from 0 to 100 units depending on the nearness to what is expected of them.</p>
                <p>&bullet; The assigned scores are translated with the A-F scale earlier mentioned and that becomes the grade of that student in that very course. Below is a sample of the representative scale:</p>

                <p>The scale above shows that 45 is the bench mark to adjudge a student as eligible to proceed or repeat that course when the reverse is the case. Nonetheless, this do not apply to certain courses especially 
                those in the Medical and para-medical sciences where the least acceptable performance is average(50-59), indicating that a student's who is unable to achieve the bench mark of 50 out of 100 will have to repeat 
                such a course. However, in cases where a course is optional or elective, a student is not required to retake it reason being that it may not be of much relevance to a student's discipline aside from the 
                general knowledge it offers to the student.</p>

                <h2 id="GP">Grade-point, Grade-point Average, and Cummulative Grade-point Average</h2>
                <p>In each semester, each of the several courses registered for carry different number of units ranging between 2 units to 15 units as in the case of industrial training and the grade which a student is able to achieve 
                in each of these courses is multiplied by the course units to get the grade point(GP) in that particular course. For instance, if a students achieves a score of 68 after continuous assessment and examination in a certain 
                3 units course, his/her grade in that course is 'B' that is, 4 points indicating a very good performance. To get his/her grade point in that course, the achieved 4 points is multiplied by 3 being the units of the course.</p>
                <p>GP= 4 x 3</p>
                <p>GP=12</p>
                <p>When a studet registers for 10 courses in a semester and the unit of each is 2 units, the grade point(GP) of all the courses is summed up and divided by the total units to get the grade point average (GPA) in that semester.
                If he/she for instance makes 'A' in 7 out of 10 courses and made 'B' the remaining 3 courses, the GPs can be calculated as follows;</p>
                <p>course 1: 5 x 2 = 10</p>
                <p>course 2: 5 x 2 = 10</p>

                <p>course 10: 4 x 2 = 8</p>
                <p>Total GP= 94</p>
                <p>Total Units= 20</p>
                <p>Grade-point Average(GPA) = 4.70</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>In a session, there are two semesters and if the above GPA is obtained in the first and a GPA of 4.90 is achieved in the second, the cummulative grade point average(CGPA) is gotten by computing the average of 4.70 and 4.90</p>
                <p>CGPA= 4.80</p>
                <P>Subsequently, the GPA in every semester in the course of the program is cummulated and the average is used in final placement before the degree is awarded after every obligation might have been fulfilled.</P>

                <p>Delsu lecture halls and theathers are specially designed to foster learning. The halls take less number of students per time as compared with the theaters. The lectue halls and theaters are fitted with adequate lighting systems, despite the abundance of natural light the facilities can take in. They are well ventilated, the seats and desk in some of them are immoble while others are moveable. They are mainly for lectures but can also support other student activities
                which promotes learning. There are halls and theaters dedicated to specific disciplines while there are those which could serve the general student community. Access to these facilities is by lecture schedule. You may only be allowed to use these halls and theathers if they were allocated to your group. Each level of a particular discipline makes a group and a representative is expected to sign in for and ensures every member of the group makes responsible 
                use of the facilities.</p>

                <p>A library is a facility which holds books and/or other forms of media containing stored information for use by the public or qualified persons often lending them out, as well as providing various other services for its users. The Delta State University Library system operates in all Delsu campuses as the university runs a multi-campus system. The main library is located opposite Student Affairs Division at site 2 of the main at campus Abraka. Within each faculty
                complexes and departments, there are libraries holding mainly materials relevant to the disciplines and access to which require permission from appropriate quarters especially in borrowing if you are not a student in that discipline. This category of libraries operates during week days and are open for service between 8.00am - 5.00pm during semester periods but may only be open during school vacation on special arrangements and remain closed during public holidays.
                With Delsu E-Library services which will soon become fully functional, you will be able access our library resources online.</p>

                <p>A workshop is a room or building in which goods are manufactured or repaired. Workshops house instruments, tools, machinery etc for manufacturing or handicrafts. The infrastructure is designed to allow for ease of manipulation of varous heavy, medium, and light weight equipments. Moreso, they are designed to incorporate a variety of safety measures like fire alarms, fume extractors, anti-slip floors, emergency exits, mustering points, ventilation, lighting, etc. 
                Delta State University has multiple workshops deigned to serve various manufacturing or repair purposes as part of its effort to break off from 'Theory Dominated Education' to offer 'Practical and Skill Rich Education'. These workshops provide the necessary conditions for students to put into practice what they have acquired theoretically while engaged in productive ventures. The facilities and equipments found in each of these workshops depends on the nature of work carried out. 
                While welding machines, welding electrodes, steel plates, steel sheets etc may be found in welding, fabrication, and metal workshops, 2 shaft table looms, 4 shaft table looms, floor looms, inkle looms, pressing iron etc are the major machinery found in weaving and fabric manufacture workshops.</p> 
                <p>Workshop activities provide direct, real, and purposeful experience to students as well as enhance their creativity as they work on different projects individually or in groups. The workshops are sited away from lecture halls and other learning facilities where quietness and calmness is highly required but within the university campuses so as to provide students with adequate security. Workshop activities come with some hazards to which safety measures and officials are on ground 
                to put out or at least keep in check to allow students go about their businesses. Access to these facilities is reserved to students on the account of practicals and it is not advisable to use these facilities without guidance and direction from officials as they are in they are in the best position to help you in the case of an emergency.</p>
                <p>Delsu Workshops are located at The Center for Entrepreneural Studies near Electronic Examination Center in site 3 Abraka Campus, Delta State University, Abraka.</p>

                <p>A meteorological station is a place or facility for observing, measuring, recording and transmission of metrological data for the purpose of studying and forecasting weather and climate. The atmospheric conditions studied include temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation amounts.  A meteorological station is a very important learning facility at least to some disciplines. One can simply say that the facility is for studying atmospheric 
                phenomena. This scientific study is known as meteorology and forms a major field in the curriculum of some disciplines especially 'Geograpphy and Regional Planning'. In a typical meteorological station you will find a host of instruments like barometers, hygroscopes, rain guage, wind anaemometer, wind vane, thermometers, and many more. Delta State University has a meteorological station located in site 3 of Abraka campus. The facility supports great learning. It is used to expose students 
                to direct experience and to make them gain practical knowledge of what they have learnt theoretically. Access to the facility is limited to students who are that discipline area and a high level responsibility is required of any user just like in other learning facilities. The facility is in the open fields behind Convocation Arena behind Faculty of Social Sciences Complex in site 3, Delta State University, Abraka.</p>

                <p>WiFi, wireless fidelity is a wireless technology used to connect computers, tablets, smartphones and other devices to the internet. It is a simple internet connection that is shared with and among multiple devices through a wireless router. The router is 
                connected to an internet modem which acts as a hub to disseminate the internet signal to every other WiFi enabled devices. The wireless connection allows for flexibility and enhances greater productivity so long the connected devices are within 
                coverage area. In this information age, every aspect of human endeavour has benefited greatly from the internet and education is not left out. Nevertheless, with the high cost of internet associated technology, it becomes quite unaffordable at least to some 
                category of persons to make the most of the internet in meeting their educational needs. To solve this problem, Delta State University provides free internet connection with her wireless fidelity network (DELSU CONNECT). The coverage area is just about some 
                squared kilometers and the signal is strongest in some stratregic places within the campuses. In site 3 of Abraka campus for instance, the signal is strongest around Faculty Complexes, Convocation Arena, Convocation Hall, Computer Science Laboratory, NDDC Hall 
                of Residence, and other spots where students are likely to converge.</p>
                <p>With 'Delsu Connect', students and staff are able to have free, limitless, and secured internet access for internet based research. To use the facility is very simple. All you have to do is open your wifi enabled device, connect to Delsu Connect and you are on.</p>

                <p>With digitalization, computer based testing (CBT) has become ingrained in education. It simply refers to testing and assessing students through the use of the organised computers systems. It has been highly encouraged because it has the ability to automate the cumbersome 
                and time-consuming tasks associated with testing like marking and scoring. A CBT center is a facility, a building, or a location where Computer Based Testing can be conducted. Like handwriten examination, CBT is conducted in facilities that are capable of providing convenience for the testees. 
                The major divide between CBT centers and handwriten examination centers is in design and equipments that they contain. The buildings are designed to house computers and people. The furnitures in here are typical chairs and desks of different kinds that can provide comfort to users. There is 
                emergency exit, mustering point, and all other safety measures. Delta State University Computer Based Testing Centers are not very different from other CBT centers you have been to or will be except in terms of the model of computers that are in use. Delsu CBT centers' equipment are regularly 
                upgraded. There are desktop and laptop computers and other peripheral devices. The CBT centers are well manned by officials that will provide you with all the guidance you may need for effective use. Access to the CBT centers may only be granted to you if you have an examination slated there. 
                Some areas in these facilities are marked 'Out of Bound' and you are not expected to go there. Failure to comply with this and other directives at the centers would mean challenging authority and of course comes with unique consequences.</p>
                <p>Delta State University as of the time being has three CBT centers or Electronic Examination Halls in Abraka campus and one at Oleh campus. They are located as follows;</p>
                <h4>Electronic Examination Hall A;</h4>Electronic Examination Hall A is located at Right Wing of Examination Center in site 3 Abraka Campus near 750 Capacity Hall C close to The Center for Entrepreneural Studies.
                <h4>Electronic Examination Hall B;</h4>Electronic Examination Hall B is located at Left Wing of Examination Center in site 3 Abraka Campus near 750 Capacity Hall C close to The Center for Entrepreneural Studies.
                <h4>ICT Center (Abraka Campus);</h4>ICT Center is located at Delta State University ICT Center near Eco Hall in site 2, Abraka Campus.
                <h4>ICT Center (Oleh Campus);</h4>ICT Center is located at Delta State University ICT Center in Old Engineering Faculty, Oleh Campus.
