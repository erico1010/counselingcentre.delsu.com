             <h3>What is counselling?</h3>
               Counselling is unique relationship between a professional counselor and a person or group of persons having psychological problems. In its simplest definition, it is a helping relationship between a counselor and a troubled person(s) aimed at assisting the challenged person or persons to resolve their problems.

             <h3>What is therapy?</h3>
              Therapy is often used interchangeably with counselling as both have the same orientation. Psychoterapy as it were, is a talking relation between a therapist and a client having a non-specific trouble aimed at making the individual(s) get better through psychological means. Counselling is more specific, directed at problem exploration and therefore short termed, while therapy is non-specific, directed at making client feel and become better and therefore more long termed.

             <h3>How can I tell I need either of both?</h3>
              You can tell you need either of both when you feel disturbed and lose your sense of complacense, when you've tried self-help and you don't seem to be getting better, when you having a hard time getting along with yourself and other persons or when you realise all is not well with you. Your therapist or counselor will determine what best you need.

             <h3> What is the difference between counselling or therapy and talking with a friend?</h3>    
              Talking with a friend can be a good source of help but getting professional help is better. Your counselor or therapist being a professional will be geniunely interested in helping you and is in a better position to do so because of training and experience. You are more at risk of losing confidentiality in talking with a friend than talking with a professional who will in no normal circumstance reveal your sensitive informations to a third ear like friends have done in many cases. Another difference is on the issue of dual relationship. Your friend is your friend and your discussion will be prone to double standards where keeping the existing friendship will be placed at premium at the expense true problem exploration in the lights of reality like a professional would. A professional will be sincere, geniune, and committed to helping you resolve your problems at any lenght with your cooperation.

             The centre has a number of professionals assigned to clients on the basis of expertise. We have counselors who are specialists in human sexuality and will be in the best position to help you if your problems are thus inclined. If they are academic inclined those in that area will be assigned to you. In the case of crisis, the director takes charge of attending to you or may assign another counselor to attend to if his schedule can not permit. Simply put, the nature of your challenge will determine who your counselor will be.

             <h3>How long does therapy take to complete?</h3></h3>    
               The duration of counselling or therapy can vary widely depending on the nature of the problem and commitment to the process of change. It can also be determined by the frequency of sessions which is jointly determined by you and your therapist. Basically, therapy can range between weeks, months or years as the case may be. However, every session (the meeting between you and your counselor or therapist) can last for 45 minutes to 1 hour depending on prevailing circumstances and your therapists approach.

               No. Your therapist will not recommend nor administer drugs to you. Counselling and psychoterapy does not invove the use of drugs. If your problem are physiologically inclined and requires the services of a physician, you will be referred to medical practioners particularly The University's health centre where the best treatment will be determined and administered.

             <h3> What should I do if counselling can not help my situation?</h3></h3>    
             Counselling can help your situation. It all depends on your commitment to the healing process. Nevertheless, if you or your therapist attests otherwise, the centre will refer and connect you to other community services that may provide the needed intervention. In this, we expect you cooperate with the referral process while we give you the necessary follow-up resources and services. <a href="#referalservice">Read more about how we refer cliets</a>

             <h3>Where will I receive therapy?</h3>    
              We have designated counselling offices within the Centre's block. All sessions are within these offices to provide the needed safety in the counselling process. Our counselors will not invite you nor will they agree to have a session with you out of these designated locations. However, should prevailing circumstances necessitate holding sessions outside these designations, appropriate procedures must be followed. Needless to say, whatever location that should call to mind, must be within the university's campus where your safety and that of our counselor can be guaranteed.

Nevertheless, we work cooperatively with other practioners in and out of the counseling profession to achieve this feet. We work with significant others like parents, academic and non-academic staff of the university, and corporate agencies inolved in community service of different sorts to ensure you get the appropriate intervention and help.</p>
          <p>Referring our clients follow a due process and approval from appropriate authorities. Referral is majorly determined by your counselor's recommendation following the outcome of series of sessions or diagnosis. Referral comes in following these considerations: </p>
          <li>When the needed help is not within counselor's area of specialisation;  Client will be referred to another counselor within the centre.</li>
          <li>When the needed therapy is perceived to be long term (ranging from months to years); Client will be referred to other licensed practicing counselors outside the centre while the centre does follow up. Reason being that the needed long term therapy may not be completed successfully within client's period of studentship in Delta State University.</li>
          <li>When the needed help is beyond the scope of counseling; Client will be referred to appropriate places where they can get the best help while the centre and client's counselor does follow up to ensure the referred client receive  the best of available services.</li>
          <li>When client's problem are related to financial crisis; the centre will connect client to community intervention schemes while therapy continues at the centre.</li>

          <p>In all of these situations, we expect clients to cooperate with the centre and remain cooperative as well to the third party service centre and its personnel. </p>
