Your therapist is a professional counselor and will stick to the code and ethics of the counselling practice to see your challengesfully resolved with your cooperation. We care about your safety and respect your dignity as human so expect whatever information you revealed to your counselor to remain a confidential property. Your therapist in the process of helping you may use a blend of techniques and approaches depending on his/her training and area of expertise in all of which your rights will never be violated. Our counselling offices are designed and built to meet the purpose of counselling bearing your comfort, confidentiality, and safety in mind.</p>
			  <p>On issues of third parties, you are incharge of who can be invited into the therapeutic relationship if the need arises. For record sake and improving the therapeutic process, your counselor may have to audio tape, video tape, or use other means but in any case, your consent and approval will always be sought and the records will remain a property of the centre which it treats with confidentiality and refers to in future terms to enhance its services to you alone and you have full rights to challenge how the property is used should you feel other wise. Nonetheless, if the property is demanded by the Law for a legal action for or against, the centre, being bound by the State's laws will fall to the Law. Furthermore, if the Centre perceives, there are suicidal tendencies, threats to take another life, or public health threats, the Centre will in these situations liase with appropriate authorities to get help for you.</p>

			<h2>What we expect from you</h2>
			  <p>Counselling is a two-way-relationship. We try as much as poissible to help you within the standards of the counselling practice. We expect you cooperate with your therapist and discuss openly with them. Contrary to many conceptions, counselling is not magical mind reading. Your counselor being a professional works with data they are able to gather about you and the situation to help you explore and find solutions which implementation of, rests on your willingness and commitment. Time is precious and we must use it judiciously if we must be able to attend to the thousands of members of the DELSU community that we are mandated to serve. We therefore expect you to be punctual and regular at sessions. Ensure to communicate with the Centre if you wish to terminate an appointment within 24 hours of request to enable us allocate the space to another. We expect you communicate with your therapist any sign of improvements or compliactions if there be any as therapy progresses and also do same when no changes are noticed. Depending on your counselor's professional inclinations, tasks, assignments, recommendations, or referrals may be made in the lights of finding lasting solutions. In these, we expect your full cooperation and participation in the process.</p>
			  <p>Self termination of therapy is allowed. You have all rights to cease from receiving therapy if you so wish but we expect you notify us and follow due process. You have the option of choosing counselors who should attend to you. We expect you communicate with the Centre any difficulties or challenges you may have relating with your counselor and we will assign another to you.</p>

					Our personal-social guidance services enables you to have self understanding with regards to relating with yourself and others in order to be able to deal effectively with and manage the psychological situations involved in interpersonal relationships. Life in and out of campus necessitates interaction and relationships hence the need for you to know yourself and relate accordingly. Lack of self-knowledge has led many into building relationships based on temporal passions or needs where in, they struggle to sustain when those passions die. It also manifests in building relationships along the lines of incompatibility. In other cases, many fail to make due inputs which they are capable of, put themselves under undue pressure trying to meet the expectation of others, over-expects from others, or on the worst case scenario, set unrealistic goals.

									Our vocational guidance services cover a wide range of programmes designed to help you assess your capabilities, interests, skills, aptitudes, and other qualities in order for you to know yourselves and make appropriate career choices. Many intending professionals are quick to choosing careers out of the blue only to find down the road that their choices do not permit them to fulfil their dreams. Some struggle to fit in, some under-perform, some quit, others never find gainful employment because the jobs they seek require a differnt kind persons that they are not despite the technical know hows they've acquired in the course of training or in many cases, their choice of profession are irrelevant in the society or the jobs they seek are non-existent in the economy. These have formed the basis for wide spread unemployment and under-employment across the globe. Hence, the need for vocational guidance.</p>

			  <h2>Our Professional Training Services:</h2>
			  <h3>The Drive, Essence, And Target</h3>
				<p>With the increasing complexity of global culture due to cultural mixing owing to continued technological advancement in the area of communication and other rapid global changes, the human soceity has constantly remained plagued with continuous struggle for adaptation to meet the demands and pulls on its psychological well-being, where in, in the quest to adapt maximally, the need for mental health profession was birthed and thus the increasing demand for mental health practioners. Mental health care in its crude form has been a part of human existmence especially, talk therapy which has kept necessitating social ties and religion in part. However, as a profession it is relatively new in some parts of the world especially the second and third world nations and therefore lacks supposed popularity. Nevertheless, things are changing drastically and there's been an upsurge in the demand of its services but unfortunately, the profession is barely ready and still struggling to equip itself to be able to supply the needed manpower for its enormous task and thus, the wide divide between demand and supply of professionals to which quacks have exploited to defraud unsespecting victims with incompetent, fraudulent, and in most cases, services that could be harmful on the long run. It is for this reason that the Counseling Centre despite being a service centre, exteneded its scope to partnering with <a href="https://www.delsu.edu.ng/departments.aspx?dept=37" title="visit guidance and counseling department" target="_blank">The Department of Guidance and Counselling</a> of <a href="https://www.delsu.edu.ng/" title="Delsu home page" target="_blank">Delta State University, Abraka</a> in training Guidance Counselors especially in the area of provision of opportuinity for counselling practicum thereby becoming as much a training centre in fashion to help surmount the bane of the profession and the world it is serving.</p>
				<p>Are you passionate about helping people solve their problems? Are you already a trainee counselor? We can help you in your journey to becoming a professional counselor. We can help you gain professional competence to explore the yet untapped potentials and benefits of this young profession. </p>
				<p>We accept undergraduate and post-graduate trainees up to doctorial level from other institutions of noble standing for intensive practicum exercise and also assist them in optaining license to practice and status.</p>
				<p>Connect with us today through the office of the director let's help you gain professional competence.</p>
